## Chat DJ4E

Django chatrooms site for users to share their ideas, projects and sites. Built as a platform for aspiring/early in career developers to connect, but welcome to anyone that wishes to join in on the conversation.

Consists of a public chatroom and private chatrooms that can be created by messaging users that you have added as a friend.

Other accounts can be searched for via their username, name (if provided) and interests (also if provided) - these can be customised on the user's account page, as well as adding other information to personalise their account such as a profile picture and account summary.

All registered users will automatically be added to the public chatroom where they will then be listed as a member of the chatroom.
